Blockchain Network Tutorial
1. Installation and Setup
Prerequisites

    Python 3.8+: Ensure Python is installed by running python --version.

    Install Dependencies: Use pip to install the required libraries:

    pip install cryptography dotenv pyopenssl numpy scikit-learn

Generate SSL Certificates

To enable secure peer-to-peer communication, generate SSL certificates for your server:

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server.key -out server.crt -days 365

Environment Setup

Create a .env file in the same directory as the code to securely store your ACCESS_TOKEN, which will authenticate peer connections:

ACCESS_TOKEN=your_secure_token_here

2. Key Concepts and Classes

This blockchain project is organized around modular classes that each manage core aspects of blockchain, networking, compliance, and security.

    Blockchain Core: Manages blocks, transactions, and chain validation.
        Block: Represents individual blocks with transaction data.
        Transaction: Handles creating and signing transactions.
        Blockchain: Manages the chain, mining, and difficulty adjustments.

    Compliance and Privacy Modules:
        GeoSovereign: Identifies geographic regions for regulatory compliance.
        RegBlock: Enforces regulatory rules like GDPR or regional laws based on detected regions.
        TransparencySuite: Tracks user consent for data storage and usage.
        ErasureGuard: Provides a way to nullify transactions for "right to be forgotten" compliance.

    Machine Learning Anomaly Detection:
        Isolation Forest: Detects anomalous transactions to flag potential security issues.

    Blockchain Nodes:
        Different classes extend blockchain functionality, such as BlockchainNodeSecure for encrypted transactions and BlockchainNodeAI for machine-learning-enhanced anomaly detection.

3. Setting Up Your First Blockchain Node

Start by setting up a basic blockchain node. This example uses BlockchainNodeAI for a node with anomaly detection capabilities.
Code Walkthrough

Open a new Python file or terminal and run the following code to create your first blockchain node:

from blockchain import BlockchainNodeAI, Transaction  # Ensure the code file is named blockchain.py

# Step 1: Initialize a Blockchain Node
node_A = BlockchainNodeAI("Node_A", difficulty=2)

# Step 2: Add Peers
node_A.add_peer("127.0.0.1:5001")
node_A.add_peer("127.0.0.1:5002")

# Step 3: Generate Transactions
tx1 = Transaction("Alice", "Bob", 50)
tx2 = Transaction("Charlie", "David", 2000)  # A high-value transaction, likely to be flagged by anomaly detection

# Step 4: Process Transactions
node_A.receive_transaction(tx1)
node_A.receive_transaction(tx2)

# Step 5: Mine a Block
node_A.mine_block()

# Display Blockchain
for block in node_A.blockchain.chain:
    print(f"Block {block.index} - Hash: {block.hash}")

4. Running Multiple Nodes and Syncing the Blockchain

To simulate a multi-node environment:

    Open multiple Python instances or scripts.
    Create different instances of nodes like BlockchainNodeAI or BlockchainNodeSecure.
    Connect nodes to each other as peers and exchange transactions.

Example: Multiple Nodes Synchronizing Transactions

# Initialize nodes
node_A = BlockchainNodeAI("Node_A", difficulty=2)
node_B = BlockchainNodeAI("Node_B", difficulty=2)

# Establish peer connections
node_A.add_peer(node_B)
node_B.add_peer(node_A)

# Add and process transactions
tx1 = Transaction("Alice", "Bob", 30)
node_A.receive_transaction(tx1)

# Nodes mine blocks
node_A.mine_block()
node_B.mine_block()

# Sync chains
node_A.sync_with_peers()
node_B.sync_with_peers()

# Display the final blockchain state
print("Final Blockchain on Node A:")
for block in node_A.blockchain.chain:
    print(f"Block {block.index} - Hash: {block.hash}")

print("\nFinal Blockchain on Node B:")
for block in node_B.blockchain.chain:
    print(f"Block {block.index} - Hash: {block.hash}")

5. Exploring Compliance and Privacy Features
Using the Transparency Suite for Consent Management

# Add user consent for specific transactions
node_A.transparency_suite.add_consent("Alice", "approved")

# Attempt to process a transaction from Alice
tx2 = Transaction("Alice", "Charlie", 100)
node_A.receive_transaction(tx2)

# If consent is not "approved," the transaction is rejected
node_A.mine_block()

Enforcing Regional Compliance

The GeoSovereign and RegBlock classes simulate enforcing region-specific rules.

# Transaction processing with regional compliance
tx3 = Transaction("Bob", "Eve", 120)
node_A.receive_transaction(tx3)  # GeoSovereign will detect and apply compliance rules based on region
node_A.mine_block()

6. AI-Based Anomaly Detection

The BlockchainNodeAI class uses the Isolation Forest model to detect anomalies in transaction patterns.

# Example of high-value transaction that may be flagged
tx4 = Transaction("Eve", "Frank", 5000)
node_A.receive_transaction(tx4)  # Transaction flagged if it appears anomalous

7. Auditing with ComplianceAuditToolkit

Perform an audit across the chain for regulatory compliance checks.

node_A.perform_audit()

8. Syncing Blockchains and Broadcasting Transactions

Synchronize blockchains across nodes or broadcast transactions.
Example of Broadcasting

node_A.broadcast_transaction(tx4)  # Broadcast a transaction to all peers

Final Thoughts

This tutorial guides you through setting up a blockchain network with regulatory compliance, AI-based anomaly detection, and peer-to-peer syncing. Feel free to explore additional modules and experiment with the different types of nodes and configurations to build a robust, secure, and privacy-focused blockchain application.
